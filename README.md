Contact Manager Blox Module demo using CodeIgniter 3.x and Ignition Go

This demo blox was generated using the Build-a-blox module in Ignition Go, with some minor changes applied to make it nice.  Watch for a tutorial coming soon.

To use:
1. Install Ignition Go (use the Quick Start branch if you don't want to use Bower and NPM)
2. Copy the folder *contacts* to your /application/modules/ folder
3. Run the SQL in the *igo_contacts.sql* file to install table(s) and permissions.
4. (optional) In the admin section, create a menu option to go to the Contact manager (admin/contacts)
